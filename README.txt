Introduction
-----------
In most typical digital cameras, even high-end digital single lens reflex 
cameras (DSLR), the acquired images are sampled at rates below the Nyquist
critical rate, causing aliasing effects. In this work we describe a new
algorithm presented in [1] for the estimation of the point spread function
(PSF) of a digital camera from aliased photographs, that achieves subpixel 
accuracy. The procedure is based on taking two parallel photographs of the 
same scene, from different distances leading to different geometric zooms,
and then estimating the kernel blur between them.

Requirements
------------
- The fftw3 header and libraries are required on the system for
compilation and execution. See http://www.fftw.org/

- The cblas header and libraries are required on the system for
compilation and execution.

- The lapack library is required on the system for
compilation and execution.

- HOMOGRAPHY + ORSA (an implementation form IPOL [2] is given with the proposed code)

Compilation
-----------
Simply use the provided makefile, with the command `make`. You need to set
the directory where the libraries: ffw3, cblas and lapack have the respective
header and libraries files.

Running
-------

Usage: ./two_photos_psf_estim [options] <input file 1> <input file 2> 
<outputPSF txt> <output inter-kernel txt>

Only  PGM 16/8 bits images are supported.

Options:
   -s <number>   The super-resolution factor, positive integer  (default 3)
   -k <number>   PSF support size (default 13)
   -o <file>     Estimated PSF save to a 8bits PGM image
   -i <file>     Estimated inter-image kernel save to a 8bits PGM image
   -d <file>     Save all the intermediate images in files with prefix <file>
   -t            Threshold negative values to zero

Parameter Explanation

-s 'number' : The superresolution factor, i.e. how many additional samples
per observed pixel will be computed. (default 3)

-k 'number' : The support size in the superresolved grid. For very sharp
images 4s+1 should be enough. (default 13)

-o 'filename' : Save the estimated psf into a PGM image file 'filename'. For
visualization purposes.

-i 'filename' : Save the estimated inter-image kernel into a PGM image file
'filename'. For visualization purposes.

-d 'filename' : Save all the intermediate images in files with prefix <file>

-t            : Threshold negative values to zero

A detailed documentation is in (IPOL).
