This software and associated source code are LGPLv3-licenced (license_LGPL.txt).

The source code files in this directory implement as tightly as possible
algorithms described in the IPOL article :
"Automatic homographic registration of a pair of images, with a contrario elimination of outliers".
They are made available as scientific tools enabling the verification of the
soundness and completeness of the algorithm descriptions.

These source codes implement the SIFT algorithms possibly linked to the patent 
[1]. Compiling or running this code may violate patents in certain countries.
For this reason, the use of the source files "src/extras/sift/*"
may be restricted in certain countries to non profit research and non profit 
educational purposes. In certain countries, redistribution or commercial 
use of these source files may require the consent of the patent owner.

Implementations of the model estimator and unit tests are modified variant
of LIBMV [2] open source project that target clear implementation of
computer vision algorithm.
